## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or Download** the project files
2. **Open** `index.html` in your web browser
3. **Start using** the application immediately

### Test Credentials

For testing purposes, you can register a new account or use these sample credentials:

**Email:** test@example.com  
**Password:** password123

## 📖 User Guide

### 1. Registration/Login
- Visit the application and choose between Login or Register
- Fill in the required information with validation
- Successful authentication redirects to the exam dashboard

### 2. Taking an Exam
- Click "Start Exam" to begin
- Navigate through questions using Next/Previous buttons
- Select answers by clicking on the option buttons
- Monitor the countdown timer (30 minutes)
- Submit manually or let auto-submit handle expiration

### 3. Viewing Results
- After submission, view your score and percentage
- Results show correct/incorrect answers count
- Option to start a new exam or logout

## 🔧 API Simulation

The application simulates a real backend using:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info

### Exam Endpoints  
- `GET /api/exam/questions` - Fetch randomized questions
- `POST /api/exam/submit` - Submit exam answers
- `GET /api/exam/results` - Get exam results

### JWT Implementation
- Token generation with user payload
- Token validation for protected routes
- Automatic token expiration handling

## 📊 Question Bank

The application includes **20 comprehensive questions** covering:
- **React.js** - Components, hooks, lifecycle methods
- **JavaScript** - ES6+, array methods, operators
- **Backend** - HTTP methods, API design, Express.js
- **Database** - MongoDB, schema design
- **Authentication** - JWT, security practices

## 🔐 Security Features

- **JWT Authentication** with proper token management
- **Input Validation** on all forms
- **XSS Protection** through proper data handling
- **Session Security** with automatic logout
- **Password Security** (in production would include hashing)

## 🎨 UI/UX Features
